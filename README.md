This is my practice code of Sentiment Analysis project we carried out in 2019
We formed a team which pulled data from Twitter for 3 months. 
Our focus was on tweets as regards 2019 Nigerian presidential candidates.
I pulled all data as regards Atiku. Afterwards, I extracted the relevant information, cleaned the data and performed sentiment analysis on it. 
I also visualized the entire data from the team using Power BI.
